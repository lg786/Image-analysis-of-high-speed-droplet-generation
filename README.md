# Image-analysis-of-high-speed-droplet-generation
A python script to calculate attributes of high-speed droplet generation for a microfluidics experiment
*main.py* - A python script using the image analysis methods mentioned above to find the following attributes
1. Detect droplets
2. The average speed of the droplets
3. Average radius of the droplets
4. Average new droplet generation speed
5. Average distance between droplets
6. Difference in diameter of droplets with different number of beads

*volume.py* - This python script calculates the diameters of droplets in each individual frame to compare the difference between the volumes in a csv file. The droplets are indexed in each frame, and then the diameter is calculated.
